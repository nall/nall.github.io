## Introduction
This is a page detailing some technical information on the Yaesu SSM-85D microphone.

## Pinout
The connector of the microphone is an [6P6C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_connector#6P6C) modular connector. The pinout of the SSM-85D can be found by examining the [FTM-400 Technical Supplement](https://www.repeater-builder.com/yvs/pdfs/yaesu-ftm-400dr-de-xdr-xde-technical-supplement.pdf). In the schematic on Page 14 the jack is pictured (on the right edge between the top and middle).

**NOTE**: The FTM-300 supplies +8V on pin 4

Table of pins and wire colors

| Pin | Function | Wire Color |
|-----|----------|------------|
| 1   | PTT      | Blue |
| 2   | Mic      | White |
| 3   | GND      | Black (Tinned wire on modular connector) |
| 4   | +V       | Red |
| 5   | SW1      | Gray|
| 6   | SW2      | Green |


## Schematic
While I haven't found a schematic for the SSM-85D, I did find [one](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ftm300d/posts/856903654884606/) for what I understand is its predecessor, the MH-48. While this schematic certainly isn't identical, it uses a matrix circuit which jives with the voltage observations below.

## PTT Voltages
Supplying the mic with +5V, I connected a 220k pullup resistor to the PTT wire. When the button was not depressed, 4.898V were present. When PTT is pressed, 0.717V are present.

## SW1/SW2 voltages
The mic appears to use a [keyboard matrix circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_matrix_circuit) to encode its 23 non-PTT buttons. With +5V applied and a 220k pullup resistor from each of SW1/SW2, here are the voltages found for each key.

| Button | Row | Column | SW1 Voltage | SW2 Voltage |
|--------|-----|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Up | - | - | 0.675 | 0.190 |
| Down | - | - | 1.275 | 0.190 |

## TODO

   * Determine mic bias from FTM-300 (I seem to recall it was +4V when I looked on the scope, but need to confirm)
